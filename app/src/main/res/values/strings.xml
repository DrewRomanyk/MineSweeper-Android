    <string name="dialog_help_message">"HOW TO PLAY:
    Minesweeper is a puzzle game in which the player must uncover all the cells that aren't mines without uncovering a mine cell. Cells can either be mines or the amount of mines in the 8 neighboring cells near them. The player can deduce from the non-mine cells where the mines could be at. Players can place a flag on a cell that they think is a mine.
    \nCONTROLS:
Normal:
 • Tap a cell to reveal it
 • Tap and hold a cell to flag it
 • Tap a numbered cell that has that many flags near it to clear near unflagged cells ( Swift Open )
 • Tap a empty cell to change your control mode swiftly ( Swift Change )

Flag:
 • Tap a cell to flag it
 • Tap and hold a cell to reveal it
 • Tap a numbered cell that has that many flags near it to clear near unflagged cells ( Swift Open )
 • Tap a empty cell to change your control mode swiftly ( Swift Change )
    \nSCORES:
    The scores are based on 3BV per second, which 3BV is a way to measure the difficulty of a Minesweeper board based off of the amount of clicks it would take to solve the board.
